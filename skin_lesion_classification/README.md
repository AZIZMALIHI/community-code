# Skin lesion classification using HAM 10000 data

The notebook Pre-processing_of_HAM10000_data_for_use_in_Peltarion_platform.ipynb
guides you through the process of downloading and pre-processing a data set of 
skin lesion images and their corresponding diagnosis. After running the notebook
the data set is ready for import into the Peltarion platform.

The notebook Model_evaluation_using_the_Peltarion_Deployment_API.ipynb shows how
you can programatically get predictions from a model that has been deployed in 
the Peltarion platform, visualize individual predictions, and further analyze the 
performance of your multi-class classification model.
