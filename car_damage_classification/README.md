# Car damage classification


The notebook car_damage_preprocess.ipynb guides you through the process of pre-processing a data set for the Car damage classification tutorial.

The notebook car_damage_analysis.ipynb shows how you can programatically get predictions from a model that has been deployed in the Peltarion platform, visualize predictions, and further analyze the performance of your multi-class classification model.

Both notebooks require installation of Sidekick. For more information about this package, see: https://github.com/Peltarion/sidekick
