Follow the instructions below to preprocess the dataset for the "Predicitive maintenance of solar panels" training example. For further information about the dataset, see the zae-bayern/elpv-dataset repository. Please note that the data set is subject to separate third party license terms, please see disclaimer below.

# Preparing the dataset
1. Download the dataset.
2. Run solar_preprocess.py:  
`
python solar_preprocess.py [<option>=True,False,...] {<your_path>/elpv-dataset}
`\
The preprocessed dataset file, preprocessed.zip, will be created in the same folder as the dataset.\
Options:\
--rotate Adds duplicated images rotated by 90 degrees\
--stratify_on_type Stratifies subsets on both module type and defect probability\
--image_as_np Converts images to NPY\
--image_as_vgg19 Converts images to NPY and normalizes for VGG-19\
--balance Upsamples 100% defects (x2)\
--target_size Sets image size (default: 300 px)

# Analysis of the deployed model
1. Note the URL and token in the Deployment view
2. Run solar_visualize.ipynb:  
`
jupyter notebook solar_analysis.py 
`  
3. Set the dataset path, URL and token in the notebook
