# Preparing the dataset
1. Download the dataset.
2. Run solar_preprocess.py:  
`
python solar_preprocess.py [<option>=True,False,...] {<your_path>/elpv-dataset}
`\
The preprocessed dataset file, preprocessed.zip, will be created in the same folder as the dataset.\
Options:\
--rotate Adds duplicated images rotated by 90 degrees\
--stratify_on_type Stratifies subsets on both module type and defect probability\
--image_as_np Converts images to NPY\
--image_as_vgg19 Converts images to NPY and normalizes for VGG-19\
--balance Upsamples 100% defects (x2)

# Analysis of the deployed model
1. Note the URL and token in the Deployment view
2. Run solar_analysis.py:  
`
python solar_analysis.py {<dataset_path>} {url} {token}
`  
The generated CSV file will contain the actual and predicted values for each image in the validation subset. You may use this data for analysis of the model in notebooks etc.\
